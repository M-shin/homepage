This repository is backing the github pages url:
http://m-shin.github.io/homepage

The end goal is to turn this website into a personal website to display information about myself as well as showcase some of my projects. The files in this repository were moved from my dedicated server to github, so some things are broken (php files), some are pretty much useless (unsupported.html) and some really have no business being online publicly. I am working to remove all the clutter and add back broken functionality so that the site can be restored to all of its former glory.
