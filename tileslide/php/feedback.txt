Wow I found a bug that makes this game really cool. You can just post the score you got to the /php/leaderboard.php file for super points!!!

The up arrow on some of the special tiles has a yellow box around it

Message from: Sean on 04/02:
I found a bug where a power up didn't work. K thx bye.

Message from: Sean on 04/02:
Also found a bug when a yellow tile spawned with a double arrow power up, the arrow was off of the tile. K thx bye.

Message from: Jake Courtney on 04/02:
Suggestions: Multicolored tiles such as rainbwo tile (can combine with any other color) or tiles such as red/blue, red/green, blue/orange/green, etc.. can be used as any of the colors that are on it... Possibly being able to combine 3 of the same powerup despite their colors (idk might be too OP)

Message from: Sean Valley on 04/03:
nvm

Message from: Christian W on 04/03:
You should allow for a "combo" when power ups are activated in a chain. You'd have to make powerups more scarce, but...

Message from: Nathan Mehlhop on 04/03:
Make sure that new tiles spawn AFTER a move is completed. I'm pretty sure I've attempted to slide panels to the right and had a new tile appear where I was trying to put one of the already existing tiles.

Message from: A Person on 04/04:
Maybe instead of 6x6 squares make it 5x5 or even smaller than that, for more user 
friendliness. I know that would mean less squares , amplifying the actual gameplay, but in my opinion, people would be more happy with larger squares; considering they want their game close to them and easier to see. Plus, the larger the board, the less confusing the new gamer becomes, while visiting the website.
Thank you for the consideration.
Really like the game.

I find it annoying that when you lose the game and you want to play another you have to select what game mode over again, that should be left to the "Start a New Game" button, I wanna jump right back into a new game ASAP

Message from: JackieChan on 05/08 02:24:39:
I only had one move left. Meaning their was only one slot open. I had two green squares in a row right next to the slot. I made my move hoping I would be saved and Eureka!!! I got a green but then I was struck with that blasted Game Over Screen. Nooooo!!!! 

Summary: Game says game over when the all tiles are full, even though you see a group/row/line of 3 similar colors.
